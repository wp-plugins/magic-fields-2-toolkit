Plugin adds some useful features to the Magic Fields 2 plugin.

== Description ==
This plugin adds some useful features to the Magic Fields 2 plugin.
The current features are:

   1. Create a copy of a Magic Fields 2 custom post copying all Magic Fields' custom fields, groups and taxonomies.
   
   2. Supports a shortcode for showing Magic Fields 2 custom fields and taxonomies. In particular, the shortcodes makes it 
easy to display a table of custom field names and their values.
   
   3. Identify and delete unreferenced files in folder files_mf.
   
   4. Provides an alternate related type field which uses multiple selection checkboxes instead of a single selection dropdown.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require Magic Fields 2 to be installed? =

This plugin will also work with standard WordPress custom post types and custom fields but its significance
is that it will also work with the non-standard Magic Fields 2 implementation where generic utilities would
probably not work.

= I have installed the plugin without errors but the plugin does nothing. =

You must enable specific features - all features are not enabled by default. Open 'Settings->Magic Fields 2 
Toolkit' menu item and select the features you want.
